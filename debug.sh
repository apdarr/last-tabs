echo "   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)"
echo "   - Go to 'Console' tab"
echo "   - Look for messages starting with 'Tab history' or errors"

echo "2. Check Extension Status:"
echo "   - Go to chrome://extensions/"
echo "   - Find 'Last Tabs Tracker'"
echo "   - Make sure it's enabled and has no errors"

echo "3. Check Background Script:"
echo "   - On chrome://extensions/ page"
echo "   - Click 'Inspect views: background page' under the extension"
echo "   - This opens DevTools for the background script"
echo "   - Switch between tabs and watch for console messages"

echo "4. Check Data File:"
echo "   - Run: cat ~/.raycast-last-tabs.json"
echo "   - Should update when you switch tabs"
