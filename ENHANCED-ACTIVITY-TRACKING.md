# Enhanced Chrome Extension Activity Tracking

## Problem Solved
The Chrome extension was only tracking **tab switches** but missing **new tab creation** from external sources like:
- Links opened from Slack, email, Discord, etc.
- Right-click "Open in new tab" 
- Cmd+Click on links
- External applications opening URLs in Chrome

## Chrome Events Now Tracked

### 1. **`chrome.tabs.onActivated`** ✅ (Already implemented)
**When it fires:** User clicks on an existing tab to switch to it
**What we track:** The tab that becomes active
```javascript
// Example: User clicks on tab containing "GitHub Issues"
// → Records access time for that tab
```

### 2. **`chrome.tabs.onCreated`** ✅ (NEW - Just added)
**When it fires:** A new tab is created
**What we track:** New tabs with URLs (if available immediately)
```javascript
// Example: User clicks Slack link → New tab created
// → If URL is available, record immediately
// → If no URL yet, onUpdated will handle it when URL loads
```

### 3. **`chrome.tabs.onUpdated`** ✅ (Enhanced)
**When it fires:** Tab content changes (URL loads, navigation, etc.)
**What we track:** 
- New tabs getting their first URL
- Active tabs navigating to new URLs
- Page loads completing

```javascript
// Example: New tab created from Slack → URL loads → We track it
// Example: User navigates from GitHub to Stack Overflow → We track it
```

## Activity Events Now Captured

✅ **Clicking on existing tabs** (onActivated)
✅ **Opening links from Slack** (onCreated + onUpdated)  
✅ **Opening links from email** (onCreated + onUpdated)
✅ **Right-click "Open in new tab"** (onCreated + onUpdated)
✅ **Cmd+Click on links** (onCreated + onUpdated)
✅ **External apps opening URLs** (onCreated + onUpdated)
✅ **Navigating within a tab** (onUpdated when active)

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced `onUpdated` Logic:
```javascript
// Only track when:
if (changeInfo.status === 'complete' && tab.url && validURL) {
  if (tab.active || changeInfo.url) {
    // tab.active: User navigated in current tab
    // changeInfo.url: New tab got its URL or tab navigated
    updateTabHistory(tab);
  }
}
```

### New `onCreated` Logic:
```javascript
chrome.tabs.onCreated.addListener(async (tab) => {
  if (tab.url && validURL) {
    // Tab created with URL immediately (rare)
    updateTabHistory(tab);
  } else {
    // Most new tabs: Wait for onUpdated to handle URL loading
  }
});
```

## Data Flow for New Tab Creation

1. **User clicks link in Slack** 
2. **`onCreated` fires** → New tab created (usually no URL yet)
3. **`onUpdated` fires** → Tab gets URL and status='complete'
4. **We track the access** → Added to `.raycast-last-tabs.json`
5. **Raycast shows it** → Tab appears in list with recency

## Result

Now **ALL** tab activity is captured:
- ✅ Clicking existing tabs
- ✅ Opening new tabs from any source
- ✅ Navigating within tabs
- ✅ External links opening in Chrome

The `.raycast-last-tabs.json` file will now properly accumulate tabs as you browse, regardless of how you access them!

## Next Steps

1. **Reload Chrome extension** at `chrome://extensions/`
2. **Test by opening links from Slack/email** 
3. **Check `.raycast-last-tabs.json`** - should show multiple tabs accumulating
4. **Open Raycast extension** - should show all tabs sorted by actual activity
